Heathkit H89 Emulator in C++

## Description

The Heathkit H89, was an 8-bit Z80-based system sold in kit-form during 1979-1985 by Heath Company. An identical system was sold assembled, by Zenith Data System, as the Z-89 and Z-90. It supported upto 64k of RAM, and offered several different options for storage, including cassette, hard-sectored 5.25" floppy disks, soft-sectored 5.25" floppy disks, 8" floppy disks, and a 10M Winchester HardDrive. Currently, the emulator supports hard-sectored 5.25" floppy drives/disks, the MMS 77316 Soft-sectored Controller, and the MMS 77320 SASI controller. . 
It is targeted to Unix-based systems, including Mac OS X and Linux.

Currently using GLUT for the UI, but plan to change to a more modern cross-platfrom library.
